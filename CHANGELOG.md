# Changelog

All notable changes to Foreman2 - Unspoiled are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- The macOS menu bar named the app "Avalonia Application" instead of Foreman 2.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-03

First public release: a native macOS port of
[DanielKote/Foreman2](https://github.com/DanielKote/Foreman2) 2.4.0, feature-complete with
upstream. Runs on Apple Silicon Macs, built on Avalonia instead of WinForms.

Linux is supported in this release's build (self-contained `linux-x64` tarball) but has not yet
been runtime-verified on an actual Linux machine; treat it as best-effort until that verification
lands.

### Added

- macOS `.app` bundle and dmg installer, ad-hoc signed, with a badge-free icon matching upstream.
- Linux `linux-x64` self-contained tarball with a flat launcher layout.
- Factorio/Steam install detection and config paths for both platforms.

### Fixed

Three defects present in upstream, fixed in this port rather than carried forward:

- The graph view froze noticeably on the first node placed after launch, while the production
  solver warmed up. The solver now warms up in the background at startup, so that first placement
  is as responsive as every one after it.
- Exporting a view-limited image (rather than the full graph) at any zoom other than 100% produced
  a mis-centered, cropped bitmap. Exports now match what the view actually shows, at every zoom
  level.
- The "graph has unsaved changes" prompt's Yes button silently discarded the graph instead of
  saving it first. Yes now saves, then continues, as its label promises.
